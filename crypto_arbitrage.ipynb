    "In this Challenge, you'll take on the role of an analyst at a high-tech investment firm. The vice president (VP) of your department is considering arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin trades on markets across the globe, can you capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations in those markets by using the powers of Pandas?\n",
